# Backend Project

A YouTube-like backend

## What's this?

Basically a video platform backend with:

- User signup/login (JWT auth with access & refresh tokens)
- Video uploads via Cloudinary
- Subscriptions (like YouTube's subscribe feature)
- MongoDB for storing everything

## Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Cloudinary (for video/image uploads)
- JWT for auth
- bcrypt for password hashing
- multer for file handling

## Setup

1. Clone it
2. `cd Backend && npm install`
3. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in your stuff:
   - MongoDB connection string
   - Cloudinary credentials
   - JWT secrets (just make up some random strings)
4. `npm start`

Still working on it. User auth is done, video stuff is in progress.
